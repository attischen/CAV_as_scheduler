#  Mixed Traffic Intersection Management Utilizing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles as Traffic Regulators Using CAV (Connected Autonomous Vehicle) in mixed traffic non-overtaking intersections to block consequent HV (Human Vehicles) to acheive scheduling.
Presented in 2023 ASPDAC
### /Gurobi
Formulated the prblem in MILP, then uses Gurobi as MILP solver to gain scheduling.  
### /SUMO 
Uses the MILPBased method in /GUROBI to schedule in a SUMO simulation.
